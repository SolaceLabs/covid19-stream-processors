# COVID-19 Stream Processor

This repo provides streams information and example applications on how to consume the different topics available for consumption. The event streams published are processed directly from the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://systems.jhu.edu/) available data. Any client application could consume those streams by subscribing to the topic of choice as per the diagram below. Note that the streams are provided over Solace PubSub+ Event Broker that has built-in support for a variety of open standard protocols and APIs.

### 3. Create your application
After connecting and choosing the topics to listen on, its time to build your application. Check out the examples below for applications that consume the streams

#### Sample Applications
| Application | Language | Description

#### COVID19 Stream Processors
Below are Spring Boot microservices that are being used to create the event current streams that are available for consumption. They are also good examples if you would like to consume the streams and republish them into an event broker. Note that they are not intended to be run with the provided credentials as we are running them as a services

| Application        | Version           | Integration  | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----| :-----|
| COVID19CaseSplitter      | 0.1 | Spring | This application consumes RAW JHU COVID19 data, and publishes smaller updates |
| COVID19RegionalSplitter | 0.1      |    Spring | This application consumes RAW JHU COVID19 data, splits it into regional updates and publishes smaller regional updates
| COVID19PopulationProvider     | 0.1      |   Spring | This application publishes the percentage of population affected in the areas
